## The vehicle

The vehicle has two driving rooms, and it driven by a motor with 12 volt battery, which is located at the end of the
vehicle. No steering at the moment, so the vehicle only runs forward.

## The missile

It is a lot of fun to build the vehicle, since it is quite different from the usual Meccano models you make, I have to
be a bit imaginary, for example, I used to three boilers to represent the missile. That's why the missile is so colorful.

You can manually move the missile up, representing the ready to launch state.
